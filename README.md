# Data Structures

The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures.


# Major Operations

The major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:

=> Searching: We can search for any element in a data structure.

=> Sorting: We can sort the elements of a data structure either in an ascending or descending order.

=> Insertion: We can also insert the new element in a data structure.

=> Updation: We can also update the element, i.e., we can replace the element with another element.

=> Deletion: We can also perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure.
